- **Event-based**: most things are an event. For example, when the selection of the text of the editor changes the event `editor.on('select', function(){});` is triggered
- **Extensible**: there are several ways of doing the same thing but one is recommended for consistence. The core is an event api on top of which the editor is built.
- **Defaults**: some common actions are already set and waiting for you to activate them, such as `bold`, `italics`, `link`, etc.
- **Tiny**: 1.6kb is small enough to provide no performance penalty for loading it.


## Getting started

Download the file `editor.js` and `editor.css` and include them within your code. Then we need to initialize the instance of the editor with a selector of the element (jquery-like):

```js
var options = { menu: 'menu' };
var editor = new Editor("article", options);
```

Right now the only relevant option is `options.menu`, which contains the class name that will be assigned to the menu. This is optional in case the default `menu` conflicts with any part from your code. Remember to change the `editor.css` accordingly with this

The rest of the code is structured mainly in few parts, the **actions**, the **menu** and the **shortcuts**. They are explained below, along with some others.



## Actions

An action is something that can happen when the editor is loaded. It includes changing text from normal to bold, saving the current editor or any other actions that can occur to you.

### Create actions

An action is a function that has a `this` parameter of the full editor instance. Let's see a couple of actions. For example, a simple one to make your text bold:

```js
function bold(editor){
  editor.command('bold');
}
```

> Note: `editor.command(command, text)` is an alias for `document.execCommand(command, showUi, text);`

Now a more complex one using jquery to save your changes and remove the editability of the html afterwards:

```js
function save(editor){
  var html = editor.element.innerHTML;
  $.post('/save', html, function(res){
    if (res.error) {
      alert(res.error);
    } else {
      $("article").attr('contenteditable', false);
    }
  }, 'json');
}
```

Now that we have both of the functions, we might decide in what situations we want to execute them. Let's say that we want the `bold` action to be a clickable, bold `**B**` (for the sake of it, I love that ctrl+b). Then we would add that action to the editor instance:

```js
// ... initialization as seen in the *getting started* section

editor.add('bold', {
  menu: '<strong>B</strong>',
  action: (editor) => editor.command('bold')
  }
});
```



Also let's say that the `save` action can be a shortcut 


They are defined like this:

```js
// Set a new action
editor.action.add(name, {
  menu: {} || "" || false,          // The html or icon to show
  shortcut: {} || "" || false,      // The key for Ctrl+key or { key: "esc" }
  action: function(){} || false     // The action itself
});
```

`name`: this is the most important part. It defines the action name for using it in several parts. For example, an action that you named `save` can be triggered later on by calling `editor.trigger("action:save");`

`menu`: set this variable to add the element to the visible menu. For example, if you want a **bold** button you can set it like this: `options: { menu: "<strong>B</strong>" }`.

`shortcut`: set a shortcut that triggers the action. Example: `options: { menu: "esc" }` or `options: { menu: "ctrl+b" }`

`action`: the action that will be called when the `menu` item is clicked, when the `shortcut` is activated or when the action is triggered by other means (`editor.trigger('action:<name>')`). If it's not set, then when it's called it will do nothing


### Default actions

These actions are added by default but not activated until you set them up. Setting them up is really easy:

```js
// Add a button to the popup menu
editor.add('default:italics', { menu: '<em>i</em>' });

// Add a shortcut to the editor
editor.add('default:bold', { shortcut: 'ctrl+b' });
```



## API (events)

These are the events that the API defines. You can easily create more with `editor.on("", function(){})` as we can see at the end.



### init

Triggered when the editor is initialized and all of the default actions are added. It initializes the menu within the <body>


### action:<name>

A specific action by its name. These are added automagically when the `editor.add()` function is called. For example, if we want to save we can do it like this:

```js
var editor = new Editor('article');
editor.add('save', { action: function(){ alert("Saving..."); }});

$(".save").click(function(){
  editor.trigger('action:save');
});
```
